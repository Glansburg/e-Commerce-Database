# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Hello Welcome to the readMe. page.
The motivation behind this page was to get better at working with Databases, insomia, and routes with sequelize. 
## What I learned
Through this project I learned:
* Better how to manage tables with sequelize.
* Better how to use the routing system.
* How to work with models.
* How to use Insomnia to get routing information.
* How to use chat GPT to solve one of my issues I couldnt figure out.
* How to use documentation to help me with syntax.
  
## Being new to web development I came across some issues you may see obvious such as: 
* The routing system was difficult for me.  With extra time I was able to complete it all.
  
 ## Instalation
